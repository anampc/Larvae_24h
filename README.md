### Description:
The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of coral larvae from an important Caribbean reef-building coral species listed under the Endangered Species Act (**Orbicella faveolata**) exposed to sediments collected near a recently dredged Port in southeast Florida (Port Miami) vs. reef sediments collected where their parents originated from (Florida Keys). We tested whether sediments can affect the survival, settlement and respiration of coral larvae, and hypothesized detrimental effects in all of these parameters for sediments collected near the Port, regardless of dosing (low vs. high sediment treatments).
